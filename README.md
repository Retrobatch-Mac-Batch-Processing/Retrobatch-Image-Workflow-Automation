Retrobatch is a professional visual automation tool designed to handle batch image processing through a node-based interface. It empowers users to build custom pipelines for repetitive tasks without writing code. Each node performs a specific function—such as cropping, filtering, converting, or exporting—and can be connected to others to form a complete workflow.

This application supports a broad spectrum of image formats and offers real-time previews, allowing users to validate results before processing entire batches. Additional features include conditional logic, metadata manipulation, custom JavaScript scripting, and plugin support for extending functionality.

Retrobatch is ideal for photographers, graphic designers, marketers, and developers who need to process images in bulk. It reduces manual effort, ensures consistency, and accelerates production timelines. The software is compatible with modern macOS versions and optimized for performance on all Mac hardware.

Whether you are resizing images for a website, applying filters to a photo gallery, generating thumbnails, or preparing assets for an application, Retrobatch provides a reliable and efficient solution.
